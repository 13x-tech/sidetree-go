# SideTree Go

This package has been broken down into a very small part of the overall SideTree protocol, focused on gathering the operation information from the CAS. No processing is done within this package currently. 

This package will be rolled up into a larger SideTree-toolkit module with small packages that can be used to build various implementation pieces related to the [SideTree](https://identity.foundation/sidetree/spec/) protocol.
