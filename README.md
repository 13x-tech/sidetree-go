# SideTree Go

sidetree-go is a Go library for processing [SideTree](https://identity.foundation/sidetree/spec/) operations in either a wallet, light-node or full node scenario.

## Work In Progress
This is a pre-alpha work in progress and is !!not!! production ready.

There may be major breaking changes continuously made until the package becomes more stable. If you'd like to contribute it would be a good idea to open an Issue so that I know what you're working on and avoid any conflicts and changes.

I am looking for people interested in taking an active role in maintaining and contributing to this library, so feel free to reach out.



## Contributing
This is a work in progress, but pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
